* **SQL Editing & Execution:** Write, edit, and execute SQL queries directly within the app with syntax highlighting and query results.

* **Data Source Management:** Connect to your PostgreSQL database and manage connection details securely.

## Built with:

* **Frontend:** Swift (SwiftUI)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask)

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the repository: git clone git@github.com:josh-spratt/cartographer.git
2. Install dependencies: Refer to the documentation for installing dependencies for Swift development and Flask development on your chosen operating system.
3. Configure Database Connection: Update the configuration file with your PostgreSQL database credentials.
4. Run the application: Follow the instructions in the README.md file for building and running the Swift frontend and starting the Flask backend server.
