Cartographer: A Desktop Data Modeling &amp; Analytics Tool

## Description:

Cartographer empowers you to design, build, and manage data models directly from your desktop! This application provides a user-friendly interface for:

* **SQL Editing & Execution:** Write, edit, and execute SQL queries directly within the app with syntax highlighting and query results.

* **Data Source Management:** Connect to your PostgreSQL database and manage connection details securely.

**Note:** This is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focused on core functionalities. Future development will include support for additional database types, data lineage tracking, and version control.
